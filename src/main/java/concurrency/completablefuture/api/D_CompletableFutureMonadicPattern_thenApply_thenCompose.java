/**
 * https://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture Difference Between
 * thenApply() and thenCompose()
 *
 *
 * * The thenCompose method, together with thenApply, implement basic building
 * blocks of the monadic pattern. They closely relate to the map and flatMap
 * methods of Stream and Optional classes also available in Java 8.
 * 
 * Both methods receive a function and apply it to the computation result, but
 * the thenCompose (flatMap) method receives a function that returns another
 * object of the same type. This functional structure allows composing the
 * instances of these classes as building blocks.
 *
 *
 * thenApply()and thenCompose().Both APIs help chain different CompletableFuture
 * calls,but the usage of these 2 functions is different.
