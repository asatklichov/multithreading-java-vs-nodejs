/**
 * https://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture
 * 
 * For error handling in a chain of asynchronous computation steps, we have to
 * adapt the throw/catch idiom in a similar fashion.
 * 
 * Instead of catching an exception in a syntactic block, the CompletableFuture
 * class allows us to handle it in a special handle method.
 * 
 * This method receives two parameters: a result of a computation (if it
 * finished successfully), and the exception thrown (if some computation step
 * did not complete normally).
