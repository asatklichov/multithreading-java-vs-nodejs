/**
 * Java 5 added a new Java package to the Java platform, the java.util.concurrent
 * package. This package contains a set of classes that makes it easier to
 * develop concurrent (multithreaded) applications in Java. Before this package
 * was added, you would have to program your utility classes yourself.
 * 
 * In this tutorial I will take you through the new java.util.concurrent
 * classes, one by one, so you can learn how to use them. I will use the
 * versions in Java 6. I am not sure if there are any differences to the Java 5
 * versions.
 * 
 * I will not explain the core issues of concurrency in Java - the theory behind
 * it, that is. If you are interested in that, check out my Java Concurrency
 * tutorial.
