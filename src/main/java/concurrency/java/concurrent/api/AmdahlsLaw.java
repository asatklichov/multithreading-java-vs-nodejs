 * <pre>
 * Amdahl's law can be used to calculate how much a computation can be sped up by running part of it in parallel. 
 * Amdahl's law is named after Gene Amdahl who presented the law in 1967. Most developers working with parallel or
 *  concurrent systems have an intuitive feel for potential speedup, even without knowing Amdahl's law. 
 *  Regardless, Amdahl's law may still be useful to know.

I will first explain Amdahl's law mathematically, and then proceed to illustrate Amdahl's law using diagrams.

Amdahl's Law Defined
A program (or algorithm) which can be parallelized can be split up into two parts:

A part which cannot be parallelized
A part which can be parallelized
