 * Java Thread interrupt() method
 * 
 * <pre>
 *The interrupt() method of thread class is used to interrupt the thread. 
 *
 *If any thread is in sleeping or waiting state (i.e.
 * sleep() or wait() is invoked) then using the interrupt() method, we can
 * interrupt the thread execution by throwing InterruptedException.
 * 
 * If the thread is not in the sleeping or waiting state then calling the
 * interrupt() method performs a normal behavior and doesn't interrupt the
 * thread but sets the interrupt flag to true.

	 * itself at the next available opportunity. Thatâ€™s all. There is no telling
	 * what the receiver thread might do with the signal: it may not even bother to
	 * check the signal; or even worse ignore it.
