		 * comes from the main thread and the Flux is running in another thread called
		 * parallel-1.
		 * 
		 * Concurrency models for Schedulers: .immediate(), .single(), .newSingle(),
		 * .elastic(), .parallel().
		 * 
		 * 
		 * .immediate() Executes the subscription in the current thread.
		 * 
		 * .single() Executes the subscription in a single, reusable thread. Reuses the
		 * same thread for all callers.
		 * 
		 * .newSingle() Executes the subscription in a per-call dedicated thread.
		 * 
		 * .elastic() Executes the subscription in a worker pulled from an unbounded,
		 * elastic pool. New worker threads are created as needed, and idle workers are
		 * disposed of (by default, after 60 seconds).
		 * 
		 * .parallel() Executes the subscription in a worker pulled from a fixed-size
		 * pool, sized to the number of CPU cores.
