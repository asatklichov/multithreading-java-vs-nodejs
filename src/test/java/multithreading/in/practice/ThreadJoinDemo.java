it's up to the scheduler, and we don't control the scheduler! Which brings up
another key point to remember: Just because a series of threads are started in a
particular order doesn't mean they'll run in that order. For any group of started
threads, order is not guaranteed by the scheduler. And duration is not guaranteed.
You don't know, for example, if one thread will run to completion before the others
have a chance to get in or whether they'll all take turns nicely, or whether they'll do
a combination of both. 

There is a way, however, to start a thread but tell it not to
run until some other thread has finished.

You can do this with the join() method, which we'll look at a little later.
